# Weather Charts

My very hastily put together weather charting app.

### Requirements

- MongoDB
- Node 6
- npm
- babel-node

### Installation

- clone the repo
- in `/server`
  - `npm install`
  - `npm run db-import` (can take a minute or two)
  - `npm start` and leave the process running
- in `/client`
  - `npm install`
  - `npm start` - should open the app after it loads; if not, go to `localhost:3000`

### Usage

Just select a city and data series from the menu and click 'Get data' to see it rendered for viewing pleasure.
